# Learning Scala

Here I write some code that comes from Rock The JVM two Scala courses [Scala Essential](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/) and [Scala Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-scala/)

There is also some code that is just mine where I just play around and test things such as loops, lists and so on.
